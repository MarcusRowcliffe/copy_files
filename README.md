# copy_files
Copy files maintaining sub-directory structure

DESCRIPTION
Copies file from one location to another while maintaining sub-directory structure. The root directory is taken to be the lowest level directory common to all files. The subdirectory structure below this level is copied. 
 - If any destination directories already exist they are created.
 - If any destination directories or files already exist they are ignored with a warning.
 - If any source files do not exist they are ignored with a warning.
Requires packages dplyr and tidyr (or tidyverse, covering both).

USAGE
copy_files(from, to)

ARGUMENTS
from  a vector of character file names to copy, including full path 
to  a single character vector giving full path of the root directory into which to copy
